# Batocera-Tailscale

**Access you batocera machine from anywhere in the world or use it as a vpn server**

**Run Tailscale in batocera with Subnet, Accept Routes and Exit node. Tailscale starts at boot**

***Step 1: Login into your batocera machine via ssh***

*Batocera comes with pre-enabled ssh, login using (**username:root and password:linux**)*

***Step 2: run this script for auto-installation***

*This script will auto select your machine's **architecture** to download specific tailscale files and your **subnet/cidr** so you can access other machines if you route them to your batocera machine*

***If you want only subnet to then use below script***

    curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codecs02-marcher/batocera-tailscale/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash

***If you want exit node and subnet to then use this script***

    curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codecs02-marcher/batocera-tailscale/refs/heads/main/install_exit_node.sh | bash

***Step 3: Login to your tailscale with the given link and activate your batocera machine***

***Step 4: Go to "Admin console" of tailscale and approve the newly added machine***

***After Approval check tailscale IP in your machine***

    ip a

*you must have tailscale ip in the list*

***Refresh tailscale admin console page and you'll find **subnet**(script 1) and **exit node**(script2) waiting to be approved, approve them as per your likings***

***You should also disable **key expiry** using tailscale admin console in **machine settings**.***

*now you can access your rom files, copy/paste/delete, ssh, route your entire network or use your batocera machine as a vpn server when you are out if you have tailscale running in the remote computer/device using same tailscale account or by sharing your machine to your friends who has a tailscale account with every reboot*
